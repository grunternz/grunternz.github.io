	<h1 class="headline">Ray Tracing</h1>
	<p class="tag">An analysis of my attempt at writing a ray tracer in C/C++.</p>
	<hr>

	<h2>Synopsis</h2>
	<p class="article">The scene consists of a procedurally shaded chequered plane, a reflective box that is constructed from defining two diagonally opposite corner vectors, and three spheres, two of which are reflective and the remaining one is refractive. Each object has it’s own reflective coefficient in order to achieve varying levels of reflectivity. I decided to implement the following additional features in my ray tracer; multiple light sources, a spotlight, fog, refractions and supersampling. I will discuss each of these features in detail below.</p>

	<h2>Lighting</h2>
	<p class="article">There are three light sources present within the scene, one of which is a spotlight. In order to achieve ray tracing with multiple light sources, I traced each pixel multiple times with each light individually, then combined the colours of the returned pixels after each trace. The spotlight is rendered by two defining vectors, one as the center of the spotlight and the other as the vector to the spotlight from the intersection of the pixel. The angle between these two vectors is calculated and if it’s larger than a predefined cutoff threshold then we simply return the background colour. This isn’t the best way of doing it, due to the supersampling averaging the colour values, the scene is darker than it should be.</p>

	<p class="article well code">lightNormal = light-Vector(x, y, z);<br> acos((lightNormal.dot(l)) / (l.length() * lightNormal.length()));</p>

	<h2>Participating Media</h2>
	<p class="article">In order to achieve a subtle fog effect within the scene, the pixel colour returned from every ray that intersects an object is gradually blended more and more with the background colour based on the distance of the intersection from the camera, and some arbitrary fall-off value. The following calculation was performed on each colour channel (red, green and blue represented as c below) of the pixel;</p>

	<p class="article well code">colorSum.c = backgroundColor+((falloff-q.point.length)*(colorSum.c-backgroundColor)) / falloff;</p>

	<h2>Refraction</h2>
	<p class="article">Implementing refraction certainly gave me more headaches than anything else in this assignment. To achieve this feature, when the primary ray intersects an object that is refracting light, I calculated the refracted ray at the point of intersection based on the normal for that point. I then proceeded to trace the refracted ray until it intersected the object again at the ray’s exit point. To calculate this next refracted ray, we need to invert the normal at the exit point on the object, after which the final refracted ray can be calculated. Below follow the formulae I used when calculating refractions within my scene.</p>

	<p class="article well code">cosTheta = sqrtf(1-powf(n1/n2, 2)*(1-powf(dirDotn,2)));<br> refrVec1 = dir*(n1/n2)-n*((n1/n2)*dirDotn+cosTheta);</p>

	<h2>Anti-aliasing</h2>
	<p class="article">Implementing supersampling within my scene was quite a challenge, however it was very satisfying to see it all come together in the end. The appearance of jagged edges and sharpness, especially on the chequered floor, is significantly less. To achieve this I subdivided each pixel into four quadrants then proceeded to trace rays to the center of each quadrant. The pixel is then drawn using the average colour from the four quadrant’s colour values. This drastically increases the amount of time required to render the scene as each pixel is being traced four times as often. One drawback I noticed after implementing supersampling, was somewhat subdued specular reflections and an overall duller image. Below follow some images illustrating my scene, with and without supersampling enabled. </p>
