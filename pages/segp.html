	<h3>Goal</h3>
	<p>As part of a team of six, we were tasked with creating a Java application over the course of a year that would aid writers in their creative process.</p>

	<h3>Process</h3>
	<p>We were thrown into the deep end right from the start; expected to use an agile development cycle spanning through six sprints of varying length throughout the course of the year. We had a pre-determined list of features and requirements that our product owner (tutor) reguarly groomed and adjusted according to his tastes and desires. This grooming occured usually before however sometimes in conjunction with our sprint planning meetings due to the time constraints of the course. This allowed for a greater level of communication as both parties could weigh in at the same time. Every team member was expected and held accountable for keeping track of their time spent on various tasks. We made use of the open source Agilefant platform to not only document our time spent, but also break down stories into smaller more manageable tasks while also tracking our overall progression. Stand-up meetings were expected of us and as such a scrum master (tutor) was to stand in on one of the two required meetings per week, providing their advice while also helping remove any hinderances, and diffusing tension within the group.</p>
